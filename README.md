# SH-ESP32 Engine Hat Example Software

This repository provides example software for the [SH-ESP32 Engine Top Hat add-on board](https://hatlabs.fi/product/sh-esp32-engine-top-hat-kit/).

To get started with the example software, follow the generic SensESP [Getting Started](https://signalk.org/SensESP/pages/getting_started/) instructions but use this repository instead of the SensESP Project Template.

To customize the software for your own purposes, edit the `src/main.cpp` file.
Usually it is sufficient to set the configure the inputs around line 132.
